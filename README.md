# YouTube-Data-Harvesting-and-Warehousing-using-SQL-MongoDB-and-Streamlit

## Problem Statement 
The task is to build a Streamlit app that permits users to analyze data from multiple YouTube channels. Users can input a YouTube channel ID to access data like channel information, video details, and user engagement. The app should facilitate storing the data in a MongoDB database and allow users to collect data from up to 10 different channels. Additionally, it should offer the capability to migrate selected channel data from the data lake to a SQL database for further analysis. The app should enable searching and retrieval of data from the SQL database, including advanced options like joining tables for comprehensive channel information.

## Technology Stack Used
1. Python
2. MySQL
3. MongoDB
4. Google Client Library 

## Approach

1. Start by setting up a Streamlit application using the python library "streamlit", which provides an easy-to-use interface for users to enter a YouTube channel ID, view channel details, and select channels to migrate.
