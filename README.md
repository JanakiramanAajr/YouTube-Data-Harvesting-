# YouTube-Data-Harvesting-and-Warehousing-using-SQL-MongoDB-and-Streamlit
#1. Set Up Your Development Environment:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Install necessary Python libraries like Streamlit, MongoDB driver, MySQL driver, and Google Client Library.
#2. Create a Streamlit Application:

Create a new Python file (e.g., youtube_analyzer.py) for your Streamlit app.
Use Streamlit to create the user interface for your app. Allow users to input a YouTube channel ID.
#3. Fetch Data from YouTube:

Utilize the Google Client Library to fetch data from YouTube. You can access channel information, video details, and user engagement metrics using the YouTube API.
#4. Store Data in MongoDB:

Establish a connection to your MongoDB database.
Store the fetched data from YouTube channels in MongoDB collections.
#5. Data Collection from Multiple Channels:

Allow users to input up to 10 different YouTube channel IDs.
Fetch and store data for all the specified channels.
#6. Migration to SQL Database:

Create a connection to your MySQL database.
Design a schema for your SQL database to store the channel data.
Provide a feature in your app to select specific channels for migration to the SQL database.
#7. Search and Retrieval from SQL Database:

Implement a search and retrieval functionality from the SQL database. Allow users to search for channel data by channel ID or other relevant criteria.
Implement advanced features like joining tables for comprehensive channel information.
#8. Create Readme Files:

Document your project by creating README files.
Include instructions on how to set up the development environment, run the Streamlit app, and use its features.
Provide information about the technology stack, dependencies, and any configurations required.
#9. Testing and Validation:

Thoroughly test your app to ensure it works as expected.
Validate data storage and retrieval from both MongoDB and MySQL databases.
#10. Deployment:

Consider deploying your Streamlit app on a cloud platform or a web hosting service so that it can be accessed by users.
#11. Additional Features (Advanced Features):

If time permits, you can add more advanced features to enhance the functionality of your app, such as data visualization, trend analysis, or recommendation systems based on the YouTube data.
#12. Documentation and User Guide:

Provide comprehensive documentation and a user guide for your app, explaining how users can utilize all its features effectively.
#13. Final Testing and Review:

Conduct final testing and review to ensure the app meets all requirements and functions correctly.
#14. Release and Maintenance:

Release your Streamlit app for public use and be prepared to provide ongoing maintenance and support.
Remember to maintain good coding practices, handle errors gracefully, and ensure data privacy and security throughout the development process. Additionally, regularly update your dependencies and documentation to keep your app up to date and user-friendly.
